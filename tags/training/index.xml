      <description>Using the satRday Johannesburg 2020 conference as a springboard, Forwards set up a project to help build the R community in Southern Africa. With funding from the Why R? Foundation, the R Consortium and a crowd-funding campaign, Forwards collaborated with local R users to run a series of training and community events in South Africa, Eswatini and Botswana. All the events promoted AfricaR, the pan-African network of R users, to help raise awareness of this community among R users in Southern Africa.</description>

      <description>The first girls R coding workshop was held at the Kathleen Symes library in Melbourne, Nov Oct 28, 2017. The girls learned about tidy data concepts, wrangling data tools, and built a shiny app to explore standardised test data from the 2015 OECD Programme for International Student Achievement. One of the apps developed can be viewed at https://t.co/zlw3HGzOaR.
And we had lamingtons, upside down R cupcakes (R downunder) for morning tea, and pizzas for lunch.</description>
