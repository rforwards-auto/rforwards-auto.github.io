      <description>Using the satRday Johannesburg 2020 conference as a springboard, Forwards set up a project to help build the R community in Southern Africa. With funding from the Why R? Foundation, the R Consortium and a crowd-funding campaign, Forwards collaborated with local R users to run a series of training and community events in South Africa, Eswatini and Botswana. All the events promoted AfricaR, the pan-African network of R users, to help raise awareness of this community among R users in Southern Africa.</description>

      <description>In our first post on the useR! 2016 survey we discussed the responses from the demographic section, finding in particular that:
 The useR! 2016 attendees were predominately men, typically under 40, White/Caucasian and employed full-time. Women attendees tended to be younger and less advanced in their careers. Non-Asian minority races and LGBT individuals were under-represented. Approximately a quarter of attendees were caregivers.  We now turn to look at useRs relationship with R: what experience do they have in using R and what do they think of R?</description>
