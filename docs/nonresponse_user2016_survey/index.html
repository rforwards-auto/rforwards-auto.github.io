<!-- Survey report says 456 responses, what are extra 2? -->
<p>The useR! survey received a total of 455 responses out of
904 attendees. Anticipating a high proportion of non-response,
questions were included in the survey on participants' gender, registration type
and country of residence, with a view to adjusting observed counts in each
cross-classified group to match the proportions in the total useR! 2016
population. Unfortunately the country of residence was not recorded during
registration and could not be reliably derived from available information such
as affiliation. Although registration type should have been available,
in practice it was missing for about one third of participants. This leaves
gender, which was (self-)recorded for presenters, but not for other attendees.
In order to obtain a gender assignment for all participants, the first names
were analysed with the <strong>genderizer</strong> package, which predicts gender from first
name, based on profiles scraped from the web. For participants where the gender
was unknown, the genderizer prediction was used if it was based on a sample &gt; 10
and had probability &gt; 0.9, otherwise the gender was assigned based on a manual
web search, where this led to a clear assignment. This gave estimates of
235 female,
593 male and
76 undetermined.</p>
<p>Assuming that the gender distribution is similar in the undetermined group, the
survey population overrepresents female attendees by about 10%:</p>

<td style="text-align:right">37.31</td>

<td style="text-align:right">0.22</td>
<td style="text-align:right">NA</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>(The assumption that the undetermined have a similar gender distribution seems
reasonable, as similar estimates of attendee breakdown were obtained based on
genderizer results only, where there were
52.17%
undetermined). This over-representation of females is a common phenomenon in
surveys and particularly unsurprising here as females may be more motivated to
respond to a survey run by the Women in R taskforce.</p>
<h2 id="adjusting-for-non-response">Adjusting for non-response</h2>
<p>In order to adjust for the difference in gender balance between the sample and
the full population, weights may be computed for males and females so that the
ratio of females to males based on adjusted counts (sum of weights in each
category) is equal to that estimated for the full sample. Specifically, the
weight for females is
0.76
and the weight for males is
1.14.</p>
<p>These weights can then be used in further analysis, for example when tabulating
by another survey variable. Here we will consider a few examples for
illustration.</p>
<h3 id="age">Age</h3>
<p>The unweighted and weighted densities have a very similar shape, but using the
weighting shifts the density slightly to the left, i.e. when females are
down-weighted there is a slight shift to a generally older population.</p>

<p>Again the differences between unweighted and weighted counts are small here,
however there is a consistent shift from less financially secure positions
(student, unemployed and employed non-permenantly in academia) to more
financially secure positions (employed permenantly in academia, employed in
industry). This tallies with the younger distribution of females noted
above.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The examples above illustrate that the difference between unweighted and
weighted counts tends to be small and is unlikely to affect conclusions
drawn about the distribution of a particular variable in the useR! population as
a whole.</p>
<p>Where there is a material difference between unweighted and weighted counts,
this can be attributed to gender, since the weighting only depends on this
factor. In this case it would be more interesting to explore the gender
difference by showing a summary grouped by gender and then the weighting becomes
irrelevant as we are no longer trying to represent the whole population.</p>
<p>Summarising by gender will necessarily exclude individuals that are non-binary
or have not stated their gender. In addition, summarising by gender can result
in (more) categories containing only a few individuals, which is undesirable
as we wish to protect anonymity. Therefore a grouped summary should only be
used when there is a substantive gender difference and small groups can be
combined without too much loss of information. First considering the
unweighted and weighted counts can help in making this judgement. Using the
weights in this exploratory way is perhaps more appropriate than using them to
adjust the counts, given that they are based in part on predicted data.</p>
<h2 id="grouped-summaries">Grouped Summaries</h2>
<p>Here we show how the conclusions of the previous section might be applied to
our illustrative questions.</p>
<h3 id="age-1">Age</h3>
<p>The difference in density between weighted and unweighted is small but
consistent across a wide age range so deserves further exploration. Since we are
using a density summary there is no issue with small sub-groups.</p>
<p>Breaking down by gender shows the difference in age distribution much more
clearly:</p>
<p><img src="/images/reports/nonresponse_useR2016_survey/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<h3 id="education-level-1">Education level</h3>
<p>Although there is some evidence of a more educated male population (weighted
counts shift to higher education levels) the difference is small. In addition
the numbers without university-level education are very small and even combined
with the missing group there is potential that individuals are identified when
broken down by gender. Therefore it is best to keep genders combined here and
base the final summary on unweighted counts.</p>
<p><img src="/images/reports/nonresponse_useR2016_survey/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<h3 id="employment-status-1">Employment status</h3>
<p>Here the shift from unweighted counts to weighted counts is larger. Although
there are small groups, these can reasonably be combined into an &ldquo;Other&rdquo;
category.</p>
<p><img src="/images/reports/nonresponse_useR2016_survey/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<h3 id="time-using-r-1">Time using R</h3>
<p>Again there are material differences between unweighted and weighted counts,
here the original groups can be left as is:</p>
<p><img src="/images/reports/nonresponse_useR2016_survey/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<h3 id="recreational-use-of-r-1">Recreational use of R</h3>
<p>Here there is a clear difference between unweighted and weighted counts. As only
four people (men) said that they used R primarily as a recreational activity,
this can be combined with the missing category:</p>
<p><img src="/images/reports/nonresponse_useR2016_survey/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Where there is no material difference between genders, the over-representation
of women in the sample is unimportant. Where there is a substantive difference,
it is interesting to explore this difference in a grouped summary, where again
the over-representation of women becomes irrelevant as males and females are
summarised separately.</p>
<p>Therefore rather than base final summaries on weighted counts, which are based
in part on predicted data, it is better to use the weighted counts as a guide to
when a grouped summary is appropriate.</p>
