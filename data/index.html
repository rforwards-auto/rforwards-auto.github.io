<h3 id="current-efforts">Current Efforts</h3>
<p>The survey sub-team is focused on monitoring diversity and exploring obstacles,
motivations, and involvement of useRs in the community. Diversity will be
monitored via basic demographic summaries from specifically designed surveys
or other community surveys (e.g. useR! feedback survey).</p>
<h3 id="former-efforts">Former Efforts</h3>
<p>The taskforce collates data on the gender breakdown and other demographics of
contributors to the R project, particularly R Foundation supported activities.
For many of the gender summaries the gender was predicted based on first name,
giving a rough approximation that assumes binary gender categories.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://gustavopinto.org/lost+found/saner-rene2018.pdf">Pinto, Wiese &amp; Dias (2018). How Do Scientists Develop Scientific Software? An External Replication</a>, the authors surveyed CRAN maintainers that self-identified as a
scientist. The survey was conducted starting in late November 2017 and ending in early January 2018. The respondents were contacted
by email and asked to complete an online questionnaire, with a response rate of 24% (a total of 1,553 responses).</p>

<p>Data is being collated on past useR! conferences, the plots below show the
data gathered so far.</p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" src="../images/user.svg" width="600">
<div class="commentbox">
2016 saw a rise in the proportion of female attendees from 19% to 28%. </div>
<p>The proportion of contributed presentations is similar to the proportion of female
attendees, showing that women are as likely to contribute and have their
contributions accepted as their male counterparts. There was a greater increase
in poster contributions from women than lightning or regular talks in 2016,
which perhaps reflects a lower level of experience among the newcomers.</p>
<p>Plot <strong>c</strong> shows groups that are more heavily selected. The numbers of female
invited speakers has increased from zero in the early years (2004-2008) through
one in later years (2009-2013) to two in recent years - this is the level that
useR! is seeking to maintain for now. The number of tutorials with a female tutor was
decreasing since 2007, but went up again to 1/3 in 2016. This is the target for
2017. useR! does not always have panel sessions, but apart from a panel in 2014
on women in the R community, women have been poorly represented. This is
something useR! plans to address in any future panels.</p>
<p>The last plot shows invited organisational roles. Data on session chairs is
only available for a few years, but recently the proportion of women has been
similar that of attendees. The proportion of female committee members has been
slowly rising to parity over the history of useR! (with an unusual high in 2007
when Di Cook, a taskforce member was a key organiser). The make-up of the local
organising committee is much more variable, partly because the size of the
committee changes a lot according to local needs. In recent years the proportion
of women on the committee has been similar to or greater than that of attendees.</p>
